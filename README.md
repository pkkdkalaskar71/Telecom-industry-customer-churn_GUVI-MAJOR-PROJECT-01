# PROJECT NAME :- CUSTOMER CHURN (Telecom Industry)

# Problem Statement:-

1.	The problem at hand is to analyze customer churn for a telecommunications company. 
    Domain: Telecom
    Area of Analysis: Customer Churn
2. The company is experiencing a high rate of customer churn, resulting in significant revenue loss. 
3. The management wants to identify the key factors contributing to customer churn and develop strategies to reduce churn rate and increase customer retention.
4. The dataset provided includes information about customers, such as demographics, service usage, contract details, and customer churn status. 
5. The challenge is to analyze this dataset using data analytics techniques and uncover insights that can help the company understand the drivers of churn and take proactive measures to retain customers.


# The project aims to answer the following questions:-

1. What are the primary factors influencing customer churn? 
2.	Are there any specific patterns or correlations in the data that indicate churn-prone customers?
3 . Can we identify any demographic or behavioral characteristics that differentiate churned customers from those who continue to be active?
4. Are there any specific services or contract terms that contribute significantly to customer churn? 
5. Are there opportunities to modify or enhance these offerings to reduce churn?
6. Can we build a predictive model that accurately forecasts customer churn? 
7. What are the key features or variables that contribute most to the predictive accuracy of the model?

The outcome of this project will enable the telecommunications company to gain a deeper understanding of customer churn and develop data-driven strategies to improve customer retention. The insights derived from the analysis will guide decision-making processes and aid in the development of targeted retention programs, leading to increased customer satisfaction and reduced revenue loss due to churn.


# DATASET

To create a dataset for customer churn analysis in a telecommunications company, we can include various relevant features that capture customer information, service usage, contract details, and churn status. Here's an example of a dataset that can be used for customer churn analysis:

01. Customer ID: A unique identifier for each customer.
02. Gender: The gender of the customer (Male/Female).
03. Age: The age of the customer.
04. Marital Status: Whether the customer is married or single.
05. Dependents: The number of dependents the customer has.
06. Contract Type: The type of contract the customer has (e.g., monthly, yearly).
07. Internet Service: The type of internet service the customer has subscribed to (e.g., DSL, fiber optic).
08. Phone Service: Whether the customer has a phone service or not.
09. Multiple Lines: Whether the customer has multiple phone lines or not.
10. Online Security: Whether the customer has opted for online security services.
11. Online Backup: Whether the customer has opted for online backup services.
12. Device Protection: Whether the customer has opted for device protection services.
13. Tech Support: Whether the customer has opted for technical support services.
14. Streaming TV: Whether the customer has subscribed to streaming TV services.
15. Streaming Movies: Whether the customer has subscribed to streaming movie services.
16. Monthly Charges: The monthly charges for the customer's services.
17. Total Charges: The total charges incurred by the customer.
18. Churn Status: Whether the customer has churned or not (Yes/No).

This dataset can be populated with data from actual customers of the telecommunications company. Each customer's information, service usage, contract details, and churn status should be recorded accurately. The dataset should include a sufficient number of records to provide a representative sample of the customer base.

With this dataset, various data analytics techniques and models can be applied to analyze the factors contributing to churn and develop predictive models to identify customers at risk of churning. This analysis can help the telecommunications company make data-driven decisions to improve customer retention strategies and reduce churn rates.

- Click on the "Get Data" button in the Home tab.
- Select "CSV" as the data source and browse to the location where you exported the CSV file containing the generated data.
- Click "Open" to load the data into Power BI.
## 3. Transform and Clean Data (if needed):-
- Power Query Editor will open, allowing you to transform and clean the data as required.
- Perform any necessary data cleaning, such as removing duplicates, handling missing values, or converting data types.
- Apply transformations and close the Power Query Editor.
## 4. Create Visualizations:-
- Switch to the "Report" view in Power BI Desktop.
## 5. Select Visualizations:-
- Choose the type of visualization you want to create from the Visualizations pane on the right side of the screen. Common visualization types include charts, tables, maps, and cards.
## 6. Drag and Drop Fields:-
- From the "Fields" pane on the right side, drag and drop the desired fields onto the visualization canvas.
- For example, you can drag the "Gender" field to the "Axis" or "Legend" section of a chart, and the "Churn Status" field to the "Values" section to analyze the churn rate by gender.
## 7. Customize Visualizations:-

- Adjust colors, fonts, labels, and other visual elements to enhance the readability and visual impact of your analysis.
## 8. Create Multiple Visualizations:-
- Repeat steps 5-7 to create multiple visualizations to analyze different aspects of the data.
- You can create charts, tables, or maps to explore relationships between variables, identify trends, or compare different categories.
## 9. Add Interactivity (if desired):-
- Use filters, slicers, or drill-through functionality to add interactivity to your report.
- Users can interact with the visualizations by selecting or filtering data points, exploring specific subsets of data, or drilling down into more detailed information.
## 10. Save and Publish:-
- Save your Power BI report to your desired location on your computer.
- If you want to share your report with others, you can publish it to the Power BI service or export it to various formats, such as PDF or PowerPoint.
